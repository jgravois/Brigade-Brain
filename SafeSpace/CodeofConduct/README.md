<h1>Code for ABQ's Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>The Code for ABQ community expects that network activities, events, and digital forums, that are managed by Code for ABQ or co-hosted with a partner organization*:

<ul>
<li>Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
<li>Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
<li>Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
<li>Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
<li>Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”
<li>Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
<li>Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.
<li>Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.
<li>Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups. 
<li>Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
<li>Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
<li>Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment**.
</ul>
