#Obtaining ArcGIS Online Developer Credits through Esri

##Step 1: Sign up for an account

Go to [developers.arcgis.com/en/](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/) and select the "sign in" button in the upper right hand corner.

Look for "Need an account?  Sign up for free."  Click that link.  

You'll need to supply first name, last name, and an email address.  I suggest something like "tech@codeforabq.org."

##Step 2: Wait for your confirmation email

It'll come, I promise.

##Step 3: Finish activating your subscription

In the email, you'll get a link that will direct you to a page where you'll be asked for a username, password, your organization name, and a password recovery question.

##Step 4: Request your voucher

Email XXXXX and tell them which brigade you are a member of and that you'd like to.  Extra bonis points if you already know what you want to be using the credits for.

##Step 5: Redeem your voucher

XXXXX will email you back with your brigade's coupon code.  Log into your account on [developers.arcgis.com/en/](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/) and select "Redeem Voucher" under the menu in the upper right hand corner of the page.  Paste your voucher into the following screen and you'll be set to go.
