#Obtaining ArcGIS Online Credits For Your Brigade

##Step 1: Sign up for an account

Visit the [sign up page](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/sign-up/) on developers.arcgis.com.  You'll need to supply first name, last name, and an email address.  I suggest something like "tech@codeforabq.org."

##Step 2: Wait for your confirmation email

It'll come, I promise.

##Step 3: Finish activating your account

In the email, you'll get a link that will direct you to a page where you'll be asked for a username, password, your organization name, and a password recovery question.

> The username will ultimately dicate the subdomain where people access your work, so its a good idea to use something immediately identifiable (like 'codeforabq')

##Step 4: Request your brigade voucher

Holler at [**@jgravois**](https://github.com/jgravois) and tell him which brigade you are a member of and what you've got brewing and he should be able get you a voucher to charge up the account with additional [credits](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/credits/).  Extra bonus points if you already know what you want to be using the credits for.

##Step 5: Redeem your voucher

XXXXX will email you back with your brigade's voucher code. [Log into](https://developers.arcgis.com) your account on and select "Redeem Voucher" under the menu in the upper right hand corner of the page.  Paste your voucher into the following screen and you'll be set to go!
