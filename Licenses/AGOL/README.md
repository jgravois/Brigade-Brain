#Obtaining ArcGIS Online Credits For Your Brigade

##Step 1: Sign up for an account

Visit the [sign up page](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/sign-up/) on developers.arcgis.com.  You'll need to supply first name, last name, and an email address.  I suggest something like "tech@codeforabq.org."

##Step 2: Wait for your confirmation email

It'll come, I promise.

##Step 3: Finish activating your account

In the email, you'll get a link that will direct you to a page where you'll be asked for a username, password, your organization name, and a password recovery question.

##Step 4: Request your brigade voucher

Email XXXXX and tell them which brigade you are a member of and that you'd like to.  Extra bonis points if you already know what you want to be using the credits for.

##Step 5: Redeem your voucher

XXXXX will email you back with your brigade's voucher code. [Log into](https://developers.arcgis.com) your account on and select "Redeem Voucher" under the menu in the upper right hand corner of the page.  Paste your voucher into the following screen and you'll be set to go!
